# Code Quiz Android

### 1. Question of the Day

The user gets 1 question a day. The question is a multiple choice question with multiple correct answers.

The user gets 3 attempts to solve this question. If he solves correctly, a programming tip is showed and points are updated in the backend. (From which we can further scope a leaderboard)

### 2. Challenge

This feature to similar to the QuizUp app. A user can challenge multiple users on a particular topic. Whenever someone creates a challenge, a notification is sent to other participants. They can complete the challenge later. 

The time taken and number of questions correctly solved is calculated and a post is sent to backend which will create a leaderboard for this particular challenge.

### Issues

<i>There are a lot of things to do.</i>

The priority task is to remove the hard dependency of the app on the backend and save it from crashing when the backend connectivity is not there.
